GIT – Distributed version control System, it is SCM Software Configuration Management/Source Code Management
Version maintenance helps to get back old code for reference
Distributed VCS - Multiple coders upload to same server, copy of code files are also maintained in local directory(local repository).
Trunk Based Development – Creating new branch to not loose old code version, when final code is achieved you can push the code to main branch
GitHub is free for public and open source project, for private its not free of cost.
Bitbucket provide free private repository for small teams.
GitLab – Integration is slow
